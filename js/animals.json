                "desc": "This beautiful cat had health issues her family couldn‚Äôt take care of, so she came to us, and we quickly found her a place in our shelter. She is a very lovable 4 yr old female domestic shorthair cat and she weighs 10 pounds. Lavender is all about affection and looking for that special person to spend the rest of her life with. She is wonderful indoors and she enjoys dry cat food."
